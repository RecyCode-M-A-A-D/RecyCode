# RecyCode

Recycle your code by allowing others to view, edit, and implement it in their work. This app is a tool for every developer with simple search features allowing you to find posts with specific tags or categories. Users can also rate other user's code and our algorithm will always display the top rated code so that developers don't have to hassle for the best code snippets or browse for new ideas. This full stack application was created with HTML, BootStrap, Java, SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, and a MYSQL database.
